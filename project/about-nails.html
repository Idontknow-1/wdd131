            <h2 id="tape">Measuring Tape</h2>
            <p>You can measure you're nails using a flexible measuring tape with the "mm" side in two ways: </p>
            <p>1. Use a regular clear tape placed in the natural nail and mark the widest part of the nail usually 
                the half-way of your nail. Mark right above the sidewall or past the sidewall for a more comfy fitting. 
                Peel the tape off and place on a paper to measure in "mm". </p>
            <p>2. Use the measuring tape and directly lay it on the natural nail. Find the size counting every "mm" 
                from sidewall to sidewall.</p>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>Please make sure you are confident with the sizing. If you are unsure, size up. You are 
                responsible for the sizes you provide.No refunds or exchanges will be accepted after 
                order has been started. I use the Apres brand nail tips, which may be consistent with 
                other nail artists.</p>

            <h2 id="coin">Coin Method</h2>
            <p>For the coin method, you will take photos of your fingers on a flat surface with a US coin. 
                Your thumbs will be on separate photos from the rest. In total, you should provide 4 
                photographs as shown below. You are responsible for taking the photos correctly. This is 
                a precise measurement that can easily be faulty if photograph is not taken dirrectly 
                from above and fingers are not placed flat.</p>

                you will try on each nail until you find a comfortable fit. Write down the sizes in the corresponding
