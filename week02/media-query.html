            <h2>Helaman 5:45-48</h2>
            <p>45 And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter 
                into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak 
                forth marvelous words.</p>

            <p>46 And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, 
                a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:</p>

            <p>47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, 
                who was from the foundation of the world.</p>

            <p>48 And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if to behold 
                from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels 
                came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.</p>

            <p>32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

            <p>33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these 
                things shall be added unto you.</p>
