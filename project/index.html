                <h2>The Meaning</h2>
                <p>In Mexico, there is a saying of "La Mera Mera" which means the boss, 
                    highest-ranking, or skilled woman in a group or field. This saying is common praise
                    to a person that is appreciated for their work.</p> 
                <p>My maiden last name is Mera. A name that traveled from Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona.
                    Knowning the phrase, I decided to use my maiden name as the center of my nail business.</p>

                <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Like any other girl, I always enjoyed painting my nails. It wasn't until my mom went to 
                    nail school that I enjoyed it more. She learned and became a talented tech. I found her work 
                    beautiful and wanted to be like her. I started to practice and in high school, I got the 
                    opportunity to start cosmetology for my last 2 years of school. I graduated and my love for 
                    nails grew more.</p>

            <h2>What are Hand-made Press-Ons?</h2>
            <p>Press-on nails are pre-made luxury nails that can be worn for a few days or weeks and be replaced
                without going to a nail salon. These nails are made with high quality cover tips and products. 
                The best part of ordering custom is having the ability to choose every detail.</p>
